## Overview
The MetabolomicsPipeline provides a suite of tools for analyzing metabolomics data. It organizes datasets into a [SummarizedExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/SummarizedExperiment/inst/doc/SummarizedExperiment.html) object, enabling integration with other Bioconductor packages.

Our package provides functionality for:

1. Loading metabolomics data into a Summarized Experiment (create_met_se() or load_met_excel()) 

2. Data Processing
  
    - Median standardization (median_standardization())

    - Minimum value imputation (min_val_impute())

    - Log transformation (log_transformation())

3. Exploratory analysis

    - Heatmaps (metabolite_heatmap())
  
    - PCA plots (metabolite_pca())

4. Subpathway analysis (subpathway_analysis())

5. Pairwise Comparisons (metabolite_pairwise())

6. Boxplots and Line plots (subpathway_boxplots() and subpathway_lineplots())

Below is a simple workflow using the MetabolomicsPipeline package.

## Installation

The MetabolomicsPipeline requires R-version >= 4.4.0. 

### Install the release version from Bioconductor
Please note, this package is not currently available on BioConductor. Therefore, 
the MetabolomicsPipeline package can only be installed from github. 

```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install(version="release")

BiocManager::install("MetabolomicsPipeline")
```

### Install from github
The following code will install the MetabolomicsPipeline package from github 
while simultaneously building the vignette. In the vignette we use a package 
called "table1". If this package is not already installed, the vignette will
fail to build. We recommend installing the table1 package using the
install.package("table1") command if you are going to build the vignette. To 
install the MetabolomicsPipeline package and build the vignette. You can use
the following command.

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly=TRUE))
    install.packages("devtools")
    
 devtools::install_github("datalifecycle-ua/MetabolomicsPipeline", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```



## Getting Started {#sec-GettingStarted}
We demonstrate a workflow using the MetabolomicsPipeline in a vignette.  In this vignette, we use data which consists of 86 samples (42 males, 44 females), three treatment groups, and the samples were taken
at three different time points. We walk through each of the above analyses and demonstrate 
additional functionality for displaying the results. You can view the vignette by using:

```r
browseVignettes("MetabolomicsPipeline")
```
